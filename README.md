# plot_LightField
Plots data from LightField, including back focal plane (bfp) images and E(k) images. Currently, all the code wants .csv files containing 2D arrays, but ever since reinstalling LightField, we haven't been able to export those.  Unless we can resolve this issue, the code will need to be reworked to plot column-formatted .csv files.
